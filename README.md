# Potato-Disease-Classification

Key Observations:
Libraries Imported:

TensorFlow: Used for building and training a neural network.
Keras: Specifically for models and layers.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Parameters Defined:

Constants such as IMAGE_SIZE, BATCH_SIZE, CHANNELS, and EPOCHS are set, likely for dataset preprocessing and model training.
Dataset Loading:

The dataset is being loaded from a directory ("PlantVillage") using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory function.
This step indicates that the notebook processes image data for classification, with the dataset structured into labeled subdirectories.
Outputs:

The dataset loading step confirms the number of files and classes detected (e.g., Found 2152 files belonging to 3 classes.
